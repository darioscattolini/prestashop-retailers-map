# Retailers Map
> PrestaShop module that allows an ecommerce/brand to display its physical 
retailers in a map

## Features
* Free of charge: instead of using paid APIs such as Google Maps, this module
is based on open-source Leaflet library and a variety of free tile providers
* Retailers' information is easily managed in back office and stored in data base
* Custom markers can be used for particular retailers or groups of retailers
* Browser geolocation API is used for displaying a user's closest retailer
* A searchbar is implemented to search for locations of existing retailers

## Built with
* PHP 7.2
* Symfony 3.4
* JavaScript ES6+ (use of new features in dev files)
* Webpack and Babel for JS dev files transpiling
* [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) library for map
* [Leaflet-providers](https://github.com/leaflet-extras/leaflet-providers) 
extension for adding free map tiles

## Compatibilty
For the time being the module is only compatible with PrestaShop 1.7.6 or higher

## Status
_under development_
Features lacking implementation:
* Leaflet-providers
* Custom marker loading
* Settings customisation

## Inspiration
